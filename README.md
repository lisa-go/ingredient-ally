# Description

#### Welcome to ingredient-ally, a web application that helps users find out whether the skincare products in their collection have conflicting ingredients with each other. This is especially important as mixing certain ingredients may cause irritation, dryness, and rashes on your skin.

<br><br>

# Features

- Responsive Design: The application boasts a responsive design that
  automatically adjusts to the user's screen size, ensuring that the design is
  displayed as intended. Additionally, a mobile view has been implemented for
  enhanced usability.

- Page Navigation: A navigation selector at the top right of the page helps
  users easily navigate between pages. The number beside the selector displays
  the current page number.

- Clear Instructions: The application provides clear instructions with images on
  an image carousel to help users understand how to use the application
  effectively.

- Product Management: Users can enter their skincare products on a form and
  delete specific products from the list. They can also delete the entire
  inventory list. A modal is implemented to prevent accidental clicking of the
  delete button.

- Results Display: Users can view their results after clicking the "Generate
  Results" button. The application shows a list of conflicting products and the
  specific ingredient that triggered the conflict.

# Key Learnings

- Gained a deeper understanding of using keyframes and animations in CSS/SASS.

```sass
@keyframes changecolor {
  0% {
    color: #97d1e6;
  }
  25% {
    color: #c9b5e9;
  }
  50% {
    color: #e1abd7;
  }
  75% {
    color: #98e5a5;
  }
  100% {
    color: #e1e7a5;
  }
}
```

- Utilized mixins in SASS to prevent repeating code and promote code
  reusability.

```sass
@mixin glass-bg {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.65);
  backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
  border-radius: 6px;
  box-shadow: 3px 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

- Emphasized the importance of separating functions to improve code readability
  and maintainability. Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, focused
  functions simplifies problem-solving.

- Developed skills in data comparison and analysis to generate accurate results
  by comparing ingredients against a dataset and identifying conflicts.
